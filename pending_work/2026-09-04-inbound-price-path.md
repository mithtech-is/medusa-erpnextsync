# Prices flowing Medusa → ERPNext

**Deferred from:** Phase 3 (entity breadth)
**Belongs to:** a later phase, once the mapping studio (Phase 4) can dry-run it
**Side:** both systems. This file is the ERPNext half; the plugin repo's
`pending_work/` holds the Medusa half.

## What exists

Direction is stored per price list, per store, and is already respected — in one
direction. `Medusync Site → Price Lists` holds the rules and
`medusync/price_lists.py` reads them:

| Direction | Today |
|---|---|
| `To Medusa` | ERPNext sends. Works. |
| `Two-way` | ERPNext sends. The other half is this file. |
| `From Medusa` | ERPNext sends nothing. Nothing arrives either. |
| `Don't Sync` | Nothing moves. Correct and complete. |

`From Medusa` therefore means "ERPNext keeps out of it", not "Medusa drives it".
The README says so plainly; this file is the work that would make the label true.

## The seam that is already cut

`price_lists.accepts_inbound(price_list, site_id)` exists, is tested by nothing
that matters yet, and answers correctly. Nothing calls it. An inbound price
handler would ask it first and refuse anything it declines.

## What is missing here

- **A handler that writes an `Item Price`.** Key: (item, price list, currency,
  packing unit). Create or update; never touch a list the rules do not permit.
- **Refuse as a skip, not a failure.** The same rule the catalogue guard follows.
  A store that keeps sending a price ERPNext will not take must get a 200 and
  stop, or it builds a retry queue that can never drain. This project has
  already had to unpick one of those (`customer.synced`, 77 queued rows).
- **A tier price needs its bracket back.** A Medusa customer-tier price maps to
  an Item Price on the list whose rule carries that tier code, at the
  `packing_unit` matching its quantity bracket. Medusa has no direct equivalent
  of the bracket, so the return trip has to reconstruct it or refuse.
- **Loop prevention across a rounding boundary.** ERPNext pushes 799.00, Medusa
  stores 79900 minor units, sends back 799.0 — the echo breadcrumb should catch
  it, but a tax-inclusive or currency-converted return may not compare equal to
  what was sent. Decide before writing code whether the guard is the breadcrumb,
  a tolerance comparison, or both.

## Why it was left

Phase 3's job was to stop one global selling-price-list setting standing in for
many lists with different meanings at different stores. The direction field is
the configuration that makes an inbound path *possible*; the path itself wants
the Phase 4 test studio first, because a wrong price landing in ERPNext is
expensive in a way a wrong stock level is not.

## Questions this is waiting on

See `00-QUESTIONS-ANSWER-THESE-FIRST.md`.

- **Q4** — which ERPNext Price List a price coming back from Medusa belongs
  to. There is no obvious answer: Medusa has no concept of the list it came
  from once the price is stored.
- **Q1** — what happens to a Medusa tier price, which has no quantity
  bracket, when ERPNext tiers are defined by one.
- **Q2** — how much rounding tolerance the echo guard allows, since a
  price crossing to minor units and back may not compare equal.
- **Q3** — whether an inbound price may create an Item Price or only
  update one that exists.

All four have to be answered together: they are one design. A wrong price
landing in ERPNext is expensive in a way a wrong stock level is not, which
is why none of it was guessed at.

## Decided

Moved here from `00-QUESTIONS-ANSWER-THESE-FIRST.md`, which carries only questions
still waiting on an answer. The decision stays with the work it governs.


### Which Price List an inbound price belongs to
> **Answer:** Both these softwares allow multiple price list. Based on the settings price sync happens either one way or 2. In erpnext we select the price lists that we want to push to medusa. 
> Same goes with customer groups.
